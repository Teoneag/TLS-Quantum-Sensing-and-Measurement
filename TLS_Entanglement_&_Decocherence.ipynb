    "# Two coupled TLS: the effect of decoherence on entanglement\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "One of the major difficulties of quantum computing is the decoherence of Two Level Systems (TLS). This loss of information is non reversible and thus creates issues with information processing inside a quantum computer. From this, it is easy to see why preventing decoherence is of great importance in this field of computing.<br><br>\n",
    "One of the main causes of decoherence is noise. Noise causes dephasing in a qubit and thus leads to loss of information. For this project, a system of two coupled TLS's will be discussed. We will show how noise affects this two TLS system and simulate the system in QuTiP with varying parameters to find the most coherent system.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the Physical Problem Being Simulated\n",
    "Like mentioned before, our open system consists of two identical TLS's (e.g. Transmon Qubits, Spin Qubits etc.) which are coupled to eachother and thus, are able to exchange information. We will model the environment in 2 different ways: 1 collective \"bath\", which contains both TLS's and 2 seperate baths, each containing 1 TLS. In addition, we will also test 2 different kinds of subspaces: the singlet subspace and the triplet subspace. From testing all combinations of these parameters, we will be able to find the most noise-resistant configuration for our system.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this system, we use a Hamiltonian with some approximations: $H = H_0 + H_1 + H_{int}$. The important piece of this Hamiltonian is $H_{int}$. This interaction Hamiltonian looks like this after approximations: $H_{int} = J(\\sigma_{+}^{(1)}\\sigma_{-}^{(2)} + h.c.)$. For this Hamiltonian, the Rotating-Wave Approximation (RWA) was used. If we assume $J << \\omega$ , we can neglect terms that don't conserve energy (like $\\sigma_{+}^{(1)}\\sigma_{+}^{(2)}$ and $\\sigma_{-}^{(1)}\\sigma_{-}^{(2)}$), since these terms oscillate rapidly, thus being able to be equated to 0. Also, we apply the TLS approximation, stating that the qubits are perfect Two Level Systems, thus ignoring leakage to higher levels (such as $\\ket{2}$, $\\ket{3}$ etc.). Finally, like mentioned before, we assume 2 identical qubits, with exactly the same energy levels.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on physical intuition, we expect the system in the singlet subspace with the collective bath to be most resilient to noise, because of the anti-symmetrical nature of the singlet state and the symmetrical interaction to noise between both TLS's, respectively.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim and Scope of the Project\n",
    "The main goal of this project is noise reduction. Using simulations inside of QuTiP, we will try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "-  Is it possible to make the system consisting of two TLS's insensitive to noise with our parameters?\n",
    "-  Against what kind of noise can our system be protected?\n",
    "-  What would happen if we upscale from a bipartite system to a tripartite system?<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Techniques and Approach\n",
    "To answer these questions, we will plot concurrence graphs, to see how entanglement evolves through time while noise acts as decoherence. Concurrence is a measure of entanglement, ranging from 0 (no entanglement) to 1 (maximal entanglement). To calculate concurrence, we have defined a simplified interaction Hamiltonian using raising and lowering operators, like mentioned before. We use the concurrence() function, which is specifically defined for a 2-qubit system. The concurrence() function uses Wootters formula for calculating concurrence. This formula takes the density matrix of the system, multiplies it with it's own spin-flipped version and calculates all eigenvalues of the resulting matrix. All eigenvalues are then combined and a single value for concurrence is obtained: $C(\\rho) = \\max\\{0, \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3 ...\\}$.<b><b>\n",
    "\n",
    "To plot the concurrence against time, we use the Lindblad Master Equation to evolve the state vector $\\Psi$ through time. The Lindblad Master Equation can be solved in QuTiP by using the function mesolve(). After supplying this function with arguments H (Hamiltonian), rho0 (initial state vector or density matrix) and c_ops (collapse operator, in our case $\\sigma_-$), the function uses $\\dot{\\rho} = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}[H, \\rho] + \\sum\\limits_{i}\\gamma_{i}(L_{i} \\rho L_{i}^{\\dagger} - \\frac{1}{2} \\{L_{i}^{\\dagger} L_{i}, \\rho\\})$.<b><b>\n",
    "\n",
    "For additional visualisation, we also plot the Bloch sphere and the cityscape for each parameter:\n",
    "-  The Bloch sphere can easily be plotted using bloch(). This class gives the user a blank canvas, which then can be filled with, for example, a density matrix. The class then, when requested, calculates the expectation values of the Pauli-matrices. It uses these values as 3D coordinates and plots vectors inside the Bloch sphere.\n",
    "-  A cityscape of a density matrix is a 3D method of visualising the density matrix. Each element $\\rho_{ij}$ in the matrix gets a \"bulding\". The height of the building is the absolute value of the real part of $\\rho_{ij}$. All diagonal buildings correspond to the probability of finding the system in that specific state. All off-diagonal buildings correspond to the coherences. Due to this, the cityscape of a density matrix is an useful way of visualising evolution of coherence in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"best\" parameters, we will apply a gate while noise tries to decohere the system. This process will also be visualised using a Bloch sphere.<b><b>\n",

    "\n",
    "When qubits are coupled to separate reservoirs (e.g., two distant atoms emitting spontaneously), decoherence attacks them individually.Mechanism: The environment effectively measures the state of each qubit independently, destroying the phase relationship between $|01\\rangle$ and $|10\\rangle$.Outcome: This is the primary scenario for ESD. The stronger the noise (amplitude damping or phase damping), the faster $C(t)$ hits zero.\n",

    "- Effect: If the coupling is perfectly symmetric, the environment cannot distinguish between the two qubits to flip just one of them.\n",
    "- Result: The state becomes \"invisible\" to the noise. The entanglement is protected and can theoretically persist indefinitely (or decay on much slower timescales), forming a Decoherence-Free Subspace (DFS)."
